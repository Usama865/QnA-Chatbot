       "[Document(page_content='prompt: Power BI or Tableau which one is better?\\nresponse: This is a contextual question. If you are talking about a pure visualization tool Tableau is slightly better. Data connectors, modeling and transformation features are available in both. However, factually speaking Power BI is cheaper and offers tighter integration with the Microsoft environment. Since most companies use excel & Microsoft tools they start with Power BI or move towards Power BI for seamless integration with other Microsoft tools (called as Power platform). This makes the job openings grow at a much higher rate on Power BI and Power Platform. Also, Power BI has been leading the Gartner’s magic quadrant in BI for the last few years as the industry leader.', metadata={'source': '\\nPower BI or Tableau which one is better?', 'row': 29}),\n",

This course is rather an experience in which you will learn how to use Power BI & other non-technical skills to solve a real-life business problem using analytics. Here you focus on solving a business problem and in that process learn how Power BI can be used as a tool. This is how you will do the work when you start working as a data analyst/ Business analyst/ Power BI developer in the industry.

       " Document(page_content=\"prompt: Can you state the distinction among the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), PARALLELPERIOD(), and DATEADD() function in Power BI?\\nresponse: Here is the brief explanation.\\n\\nSAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() compares the given period with the exact same period of last year as the name suggests. But it has a limitation like King of the chess board - it can go only compare 1 year backward for a given day, month, week, or quarter. If you want to go backward or forward or if you need to go 3 or 6 months/years/days you need to use DATEADD().\\n\\nDATEADD() is more like the queen of the chessboard. It is very dynamic as it compares a day, month, quarter, year, etc. over any specified no. of time period.\\n\\nPARALLELPERIOD() works exactly like DATEADD() but there is a minor difference. Parallelperiod() does not work dynamically like DATEADD().\\n\\nFor example, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous month's value for dates between 1/5/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare these 12 days with the entire previous month of April 2023 (1/4/2023 - 30/4/2023) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same days (1/4/2023- 12/4/2023).\\n\\nLikewise, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous year's value for dates between 1/1/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare this time period with the entire previous year 2022 (1/1/2022 - 31/12/2022) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same period (1/1/2022- 12/5/2022).\\n\\nRefer this thread for more info: https://discord.com/channels/1090613684163850280/1106528524023648326\", metadata={'source': 'Can you state the distinction among the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), PARALLELPERIOD(), and DATEADD() function in Power BI?', 'row': 51})]"
